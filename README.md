Name: Michael Kindell
Hometown: Atlanta, Ga
Prior IT Experience: I have hands-on experience working with a phone company to help customers troubleshoot, reset, and backup datat on their phones. Upon them leaving I would always make sure that all their needs were met and things were running smoothly for them.
Career Plans: My career goals are to be a cybersecurity analyst and then progress to a cybersecurity engineer. I know that with hard work and dedication I can accomplish my goals.
Proud project/Task: I have implemented firewall rules and endpoint protection policies. It stands out to me because that was the very first project that I have done and I had a friend walk me through it step by step.
